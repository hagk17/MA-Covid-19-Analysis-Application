#### Data Cleaning Function ####

#data considered: 
  #Weekly Data from the Massachuessets Department of Public Health on 
  #the cumulative count and rate (per 100,000) of confirmed COVID-19 cases 
  #in 351 Massachusetts cities/towns from starting from January 1, 2020. 

  #Daily Data from the Massachuessets Department of Public Health on 
  #the cumulative daily cases and deaths for 40 Massachusetts cities/towns 
  #from March 23, 2020 to June 1, 2020.

  #Census tract data from the American Community Survey on 
  #various socio-economic aspects of the 351 towns in Massachusetts

#inputs: 
  #town_covid = variable that has read in data file containing weekly cases 
        #****not the name of the actual file****
  #numberofWeeks = integer variable of the number of weeks for which there is data on weekly cases
  #latest_date = date variable of the most recent date of the weekly cases data 
        #example: 07/29 
  #newWeeks_cases = vector of strings that lists the dates of available data for the weekly cases 
        #example: weekly_cases_dates <- c("4/14", "4/22", "4/29", "5/6", "5/13", "5/20")
  #newWeeks_rates = vector of strings that lists the dates of available data for the weekly rates
        #example: weekly_rates_dates <- c("4/14", "4/22", "4/29", "5/6")
#outputs: 
  #list of 6 dataframes to be stored in an excel spreadsheet 
    #first: aggregating daily cases and death data into one table 
    #second: 40 towns' population, min, eng gathered from daily data files 
    #third: calculated totals and proportions for town level socio-economic data, joined with second dataframe 
    #fourth: time series representation of first dataframe 
    #fifth: time series representation of covid data from third data frame 
    #sixth: town level socio-economic data combined with most recent total covid cases
